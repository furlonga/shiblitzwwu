Shiblitz is a rogue like dungeon crawler that uses your real world position to generate new dungeons and enemy locations. The game is intended to feel like endgame chess, with a focus on fast make or break decisions.

##### Cantrips:
Cantrips are able to be cast faster than other spells, and do not end your turn. Use them to gain life, move, or draw cards.
