Shiblitz is a rogue like dungeon crawler that uses your real world position to generate new dungeons and enemy locations. The game is intended to feel like endgame chess, with a focus on fast make or break decisions.

In Shiblitz, you play as a Shiba Inu on a quest to kill monsters. Current features include GPS location, OSM integration, Sensor based map generation, and moves selected from a shuffled deck of cards.
