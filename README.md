Shiblitz is a rogue like dungeon crawler that uses your real world position to generate new dungeons and enemy locations. The game is intended to feel like endgame chess, with a focus on fast make or break decisions.

In Shiblitz, you play as a Shiba Inu on a quest to kill monsters. Current features include GPS location, OSM integration, Sensor based map generation, and moves selected from a shuffled deck of cards.

##### Cantrips:
Cantrips are able to be cast faster than other spells, and do not end your turn. Use them to gain life, move, or draw cards.

##### Magic Spells
Magic spells are the most powerful weapons ion your arsenal. They end your turn, but have great effects. Watch out for fireball!

#### Melee Weapons
Reusable melee strikes and movement spells. The bread and butter of any mercenary shiba.

### Tutorial
Shiblitz takes place in short turns. Every turn, a player may cast as many cantrips as they want before ending their turn with a spell or attack. Cantrips, like their namesake, are quick spells that have slight effects and work to cycle the cards that you have available.

Should you choose or accidentally skip a turn, you will instead draw a card. 

Enemies display their next target for any move they might take. This indcludes ranged attacks as well as generic movement.

Damage is calculated on attack, while status effects like fire are calculated at the end of a turn. This means that if a skeleton fires a fireball and the fireball hits you but you move off as your move, you take no damage.

This is a game with high lethality. You can not sprint from room to room and mow down enemies. You must think, predict, and bait out attacks from opponents.
